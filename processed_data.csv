"Insulin resistance is a condition characterized by the attenuated biological response in the presence of normal or elevated insulin level and therefore is characterized by the impaired sensitivity to insulin and impaired glucose disposal and utilization. Insulin resistance in brain/Brain insulin resistance (BIR) is accompanied by the various manifestations including alteration in glucose sensing by hypothalamic neurons, impaired sympathetic outflow in response to hypoglycemia, increased ROS production, impaired mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the brain, cognitive deficits and neuronal cell damage. It has been reported that the disrupted insulin signaling is accompanied by the reduced expression of insulin receptor (IR)/insulin receptor",Brain insulin resistance mediated cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration: Type-3 diabetes or Alzheimer’s Disease,Alzheimer's Disease
"substrate 1 (IRS1)/PI3K/AKT and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)/IRS2/PI3K pathways. Insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling interferes with the degradation and transportation of Aβ leading to Aβ deposition. Aβ promotes the hyperphosphorylation of tau, accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and the later promotes the neuro-inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, impairments of energy metabolism, synaptic disconnections, and hippocampus atrophy. Therefore, the impaired insulin signaling and the insulin promote cognitive deficits and neuronal cell death in the affected individuals. BIR is mainly responsible for the cognitive deficits and the neuronal damage in the patients of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the present work, authors describe the BIR,",Brain insulin resistance mediated cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration: Type-3 diabetes or Alzheimer’s Disease,Alzheimer's Disease

"Glycoprotein 88 (GP88) is a secreted biomarker overexpressed in various cancers, as well as neurological and inflammatory diseases. In this study, we introduce the first disposable electrochemical immunosensor for GP88 detection that is built on a screen-printed carbon electrode modified with carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Surface carboxyl groups are activated using EDC/NHS chemistry, followed by covalent attachment of streptavidin to facilitate the capture of a biotinylated anti-GP88 antibody. When exposed to GP88, the sensor shows a 19% increase in charge-transfer resistance, used as the sensor's response parameter, indicating a binding between GP88 and its biorecognition element. Reproducibility is confirmed with",An Impedimetric Immunosensor for Progranulin Detection Using Streptavidin-Biotin Conjugation on Carbon Screen-Printed Electrodes,Alzheimer's Disease
"a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 4.05% across multiple trials, demonstrating reliable sensor fabrication. The limit of detection was estimated at 52 ng/mL, with a linear range of 25500 ng/mL. The specificity of the sensor is verified by exposing the bio-electrode to a human serum albumin control, which causes negligible signal changes. We have also concluded that maintaining streptavidin hydration during bio-electrode assembly is critical for preserving biotin-binding activity. To our knowledge, this is the first reported electrochemical platform for direct quantification of GP88, providing groundwork for further optimization of GP88 detection in an electroanalytical manner. © 2026 The Author(s).",An Impedimetric Immunosensor for Progranulin Detection Using Streptavidin-Biotin Conjugation on Carbon Screen-Printed Electrodes,Alzheimer's Disease
"Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) accompanies many brain diseases, including stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain tumors, leading to swelling, increased neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. In recent years, it has become clear that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is involved in disruption of the structural integrity of the BBB. Activation of the JNK signaling pathway has a negative effect on the functioning of the cellular elements of the neurovascular unit that form the BBB.

"We introduce a novel framework that integrates Hodge decomposition with Filtered Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity to analyze dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in EEG signals. This method leverages graph-based topology and simplicial analysis to explore transient connectivity patterns at multiple scales, addressing noise, sparsity, and computational efficiency. The temporal EEG data are first sparsified by keeping only the most globally important connections, instantaneous connectivity at these connections is then filtered by global long-term stable correlations. This tensor is then decomposed into three orthogonal components to study signal flows over higher-order structures such as triangle and loop structures.

"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to cognitive decline. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a known risk factor for AD and may contribute to cerebellar atrophy, but their relationship remains unclear. Objective: This study investigated the impact of T2DM on cerebellar gray matter (GM) volume across normal cognition (NC), preclinical AD, and AD mild cognitive impairment (AD MCI) groups to explore its role in AD progression. Methods: Medical records of patients visiting St. Vincent's Hospital (September 2019–April 2024) were analyzed. Cerebellar GM volume was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry with SPM12.

"Different forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have shown strong potential as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. We hypothesized that p-tau proteoforms simultaneously phosphorylated at two different sites may have an increased diagnostic value compared with tau phosphorylated at a single site. Here, we developed two immunoassays detecting CSF and plasma tau simultaneously phosphorylated at both T181 and T231 (p-tau181&231) and at T217 and T231 (p-tau217&231). Subsequently, we measured CSF and plasma p-tau181&231, p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 levels in two cohorts across the AD continuum and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients (discovery n =",Immunoassay detection of multiphosphorylated tau proteoforms as cerebrospinal fluid and plasma Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers,Alzheimer's Disease
"In this work, we developed potential multifunctional agents to combat Alzheimer's disease. According to our strategy, fragments of tacrine and donepezil were merged in a unique hybrid structure. After successfully synthesizing the compounds, they were evaluated for their dual AChE/BuChE inhibitor potential and neuroprotector response using a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model. Most of the compounds showed promising activity. Among them, the hybrid with 2,5-dimetoxysubstitution (3b) was the most potent analogue, triggering dual potent AChE/BuChE inhibition with low nanomolar affinity (IC<inf>50</inf> ∼ 300 nM) and low toxicity to human liver cancer cells (HepG2).

"This study aims to investigate the syntactic complexity in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by conducting a comprehensive analysis that incorporates mean dependency distance (MDD), fine-grained grammatical metrics, and dependency network structures. A total of 150 adults with AD and 150 healthy controls (HC) responded in English to interview prompts based on the Cookie Theft picture description task, and the results were compared. The key findings are as follows: (1) The primary syntactic change is a strategic shift from hierarchical, clause-based constructions to linear, phrase-based ones, a direct consequence of working memory deficits designed to minimize cognitive load. (2) This",Dependency Grammar Approach to the Syntactic Complexity in the Discourse of Alzheimer Patients,Alzheimer's Disease
"shift is executed via a resource reallocation, where costly, long-distance clausal dependencies are systematically avoided in favor of a compensatory reliance on local dependencies, such as intra-phrasal modification and simple predicate structures. (3) This strategic reallocation leads to a systemic reorganization of the syntactic network, transforming it from a flexible, distributed system into a rigid, centralized one that becomes critically dependent on the over-leveraged structural role of function words to maintain basic connectivity.

"Amyloidogenic protein aggregation is a hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Thioflavin T (ThT), which selectively interacts with fibrillar amyloid structures, holds significant promise for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Herein, we investigate the binding behaviour of Thioflavin T (ThT), a widely employed amyloid-specific fluorophore, with well-ordered spherical aggregates formed by dipeptides Boc-Phe-Trp-OMe (FW), Boc-Val-Trp-OMe (VW), Boc-Leu-Trp-OMe (LW) and Boc-Ile-Trp-OMe (IW). Our findings indicate that despite their non-amyloid nature, the well-ordered spherical dipeptide aggregates effectively sequester ThT molecules, enhancing fluorescence.

"Human Endogenous Retroviruses comprise approximately 8% of the human genome, serving as fragments of ancient retroviral infections. Although they are generally maintained in a silenced state by robust epigenetic mechanisms, specific HERV groups, particularly HERV-W and HERV-K, can become derepressed under specific pathological conditions, thereby contributing to the initiation and progression of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Preclinical studies and clinical trials, such as those investigating monoclonal antibodies, indicate that directly targeting these elements may offer a novel therapeutic strategy.

"INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)-231 is a promising biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly in preclinical stages. We evaluated its diagnostic value in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers versus non-carriers and compared it to p-tau217 and neurofilament light chain (NfL). METHODS: We analyzed plasma p-tau231 in 722 carriers and 640 non-carriers (ages 18–75). Longitudinal data from 164 carriers and 132 non-carriers were available, with 137 carriers and 109 non-carriers having p-tau231, p-tau217, and NfL levels. Analyses used linear mixed effects models and restricted cubic splines.

"The choroid plexus (ChP) is implicated in inflammation and supports the clearance of waste byproducts, particularly those related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Increases in ChP volume have been associated with older age and cognitive decline in both clinical and healthy cohorts. However, the clearance of waste products in the brain is also related to sleep, and sleep quality may contribute to ChP dysfunction and cognitive decline. In the present work, it was therefore hypothesized that the association between age and cognitive performance is mediated by ChP volume, however this is conditional on sleep quality.

A moderation analysis indicated that the relationship between ChP volume and cognitive performance was moderated by age, with ChP enlargement associated with worse cognitive performance in participants older than 62 years.

"BACKGROUND: Intrinsic neural timescale (INT) refers to the persistence of local neural activity over time and is thought to play a key role in brain functional integration and segregation. While current evidence suggests that INT in some cortical regions is altered in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease, prior studies have also yielded mixed results. This may be due to improper control for cerebro- and/or cardiovascular factors, which has been shown in some cases to sufficiently explain age-relate differences in the temporal variability in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal.

In this study, we investigated the interplay between pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial subgroups from multiple perspectives. Comparative transcriptomics and bioinformatics analyses implicated the Trem2 signaling pathway in an anti-inflammatory microglial subgroup.

"Iron is a vital trace element involved in numerous physiological processes, but it becomes toxic when present in excess. Disruption of iron balance in the brain has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Familial forms of AD are primarily caused by mutations in presenilin, which are known to disturb cellular calcium homeostasis. However, the role of iron in presenilin-related neurodegeneration has not been fully explored. Using C. elegans as a model organism, we investigated the function of SEL-12, the worm ortholog of presenilin, and found that",Presenilin mutations disrupt iron homeostasis to promote ferroptosis mediated neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans,Alzheimer's Disease
"loss of SEL-12 leads to elevated iron levels and increased expression of FTN-2/ferritin, an iron-sequestering protein. Notably, reducing mitochondrial calcium in sel-12 mutants prevented this iron accumulation, indicating that elevated mitochondrial calcium drives increased cellular iron levels. This iron overload depends on mitochondrial superoxide production, which occurs alongside heightened mitochondrial calcium, suggesting that oxidative stress contributes to iron dysregulation. The resulting iron imbalance causes mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction, ultimately impairing neuronal and behavioral function. Supporting the involvement of iron, sel-12 mutants exhibit elevated lipid peroxidation, and inhibition of ferroptosis restores neuronal function.

"Alexander’s disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by upregulation of the GFAP gene and the formation of Rosenthal fibers. Its prognosis is fatal, with limited treatment options currently available. The GFAP protein is a marker for mature astrocytes. It results in the upregulation of reactive astroglioses. Reactive astroglioses is a neuroprotective condition that, when functioning correctly, helps protect the brain from stress and injury and prevents further injury. However, unregulated reactive astroglioses is linked with many neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the relative rarity in the incidence of AxD, treatment options have not been as widely investigated.

"BACKGROUND: Brain function emerges from structural pathways enabling neural connectivity and communication. However, the extent of structural-functional coupling varies across brain regions, and its alteration in aging and early Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. This study investigated variations in coupling associated with age, sex, and amyloid burden in a cohort of older adults without dementia. METHOD: We included 439 participants from the AMYPAD consortium with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) available.

"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly heterogeneous condition both in terms of the distribution of pathology deposition and clinical manifestation. The organization of functional brain networks is related to AD pathology, with recent work showing that higher dementia severity is related to the desegregation of brain networks (Zhang et al., 2023). However, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of these changes in network segregation and how they contribute to different cognitive deficit profiles remains an open area of research. To contribute to this question, we applied a clustering-based data-driven disease progression model to system-level measures of network organization.

Its dysregulation is closely associated with various diseases. Autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12), a core member of the ubiquitin-like protein family, covalently binds to ATG5 through a ubiquitin-like conjugation system to form the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex. This complex directly regulates the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, making ATG12 a key molecule in the initiation of autophagy.

It promotes apoptosis by binding to anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (e.g., Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) and enhances host antiviral immunity by regulating the NF- κB and interferon signaling pathways. Moreover, ATG12 deficiency can lead to mitochondrial biogenesis impairment, energy metabolism disorders, and substrate-dependent metabolic shifts, underscoring its pivotal role in cellular metabolic homeostasis. At the disease level, dysregulation of ATG12 expression is closely linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. By modulating the dynamic balance between autophagy and apoptosis, ATG12 influences cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance.

Furthermore, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, ATG12 mitigates protein toxicity by enhancing mitochondrial autophagy. In cardiovascular diseases, it alleviates ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating cardiomyocyte autophagy and apoptosis, demonstrating its broad regulatory role across various pathological conditions. Genetic studies further underscore the clinical significance of ATG12. Polymorphisms in the ATG12 gene (e.g., rs26537 and rs26538) have been significantly associated with the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and atrophic gastritis.

"FET proteins are large multifunctional proteins that have several key roles in biology. The FET family of proteins, including FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15, play critical roles in transcription regulation, RNA processing, and DNA damage repair. These multifunctional RNA- and DNA-binding proteins are ubiquitously expressed and conserved across vertebrate species. They contain low-complexity (LC) domains that allow them to assemble and phase separate but also makes the proteins prone to aggregation.

In a series of pathologically confirmed FTLD-U patients without GRN mutations, we show that carriers homozygous for the T-allele of rs5848 have a 3.2-fold increased risk to develop FTLD-U compared with homozygous C-allele carriers (95% CI: 1.50-6.73).",Common variation in the miR-659 binding-site of GRN is a major risk factor for TDP43-positive frontotemporal dementia,Frontotemporal Dementia

"Cells have evolved quality control pathways to prevent the accumulation of improperly localized proteins, which are often toxic. One of these pathways, regulation of aberrant protein production (RAPP), recognizes aberrant secretory proteins during translation and degrades the associated mRNA. Here, we demonstrate endogenous RAPP substrates.

"Eukaryotic cells are equipped with an intricate proteostasis network (PN), comprising nearly 3,000 components dedicated to preserving proteome integrity and sustaining protein homeostasis. This protective system is particularly important under conditions of external and intrinsic cell stress, where inherently dynamic proteins may unfold and lose functionality. A decline in proteostasis capacity is associated with the aging process, resulting in a reduced folding efficiency of newly synthesized proteins and a deficit in the cellular capacity to degrade misfolded proteins. A critical consequence of PN insufficiency is the accumulation of cytotoxic protein aggregates that underlie various age-related neurodegenerative conditions and other pathologies.",Interplay of Proteostasis Capacity and Protein Aggregation: Implications for Cellular Function and Disease,Frontotemporal Dementia

"Introduction A variety of sporadic and familial neurodegenerative disorders, characterized clinically by dementia and/or motor dysfunction, demonstrate intracellular accumulations of filamentous material composed of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau (See chapters 29, ‘Neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease’, 34, ‘Pick's and other frontotemporal dementias’, 44, ‘Progressive supranuclear palsy’, and 45, ‘Corticobasal degeneration’). The term ‘tauopathies’ was coined to refer to this seemingly heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with filamentous tau deposits as their predominant histopathological feature. The progressive accumulation of filamentous tau inclusions in the absence of other disease-specific neuropathological abnormalities provided circumstantial evidence implicating tau dysfunction in disease onset and/or progression.",Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to Chromosome 17,Frontotemporal Dementia

"Frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, which has three cardinal features: behavioral and personality changes, cognitive impairment, and motor symptoms. FTDP-17 was defined during the International Consensus Conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1996. The prevalence and incidence remain unknown but FTDP-17 is an extremely rare condition. It is caused by mutations in the tau gene, which encodes a microtubule-binding protein. Over 100 families with 38 different mutations in the tau gene have been identified worldwide. The phenotype of FTDP-17 varies not only between families carrying different mutations but also between",Frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17),Frontotemporal Dementia
"and within families carrying the same mutations. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disorder are thought to be related to the altered proportion of tau isoforms or to the ability of tau to bind microtubules and to promote microtubule assembly. Definitive diagnosis of FTDP-17 requires a combination of characteristic clinical and pathological features and molecular genetic analysis. Genetic counseling should be offered to affected and at-risk individuals; for most subtypes, penetrance is incomplete. Currently, treatment for FTDP-17 is only symptomatic and supportive.

"For mostly arbitrary reasons, the term ""juvenile parkinsonism"" is restricted to patients aged 20 years or younger, and ""young-onset PD"" (YOPD) is onset between ages 21 and 40 years. Previous studies suggest that YOPD has a slower disease progression and a greater incidence and earlier appearance of l-dopa-induced dyskinesias and motor fluctuations. Therefore, our therapeutic strategies have to respect the fact that YOPD patients face many years of gradual progression of disease and disability, a greater probability for developing various adverse effects of treatment, and worsening of quality of life.

In Lewy body disease (LBD), which includes Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, insoluble α-synuclein is widely deposited in the presynaptic terminals as well as in the neuronal cytoplasm in distinct brain regions. It is well known that the autophagy-lysosome system serves as an efficient degradation pathway for abnormal molecules within cells. To test the possibility that activated autophagy can degrade abnormal molecules, we investigated the effect of trehalose on abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein in a model of LBD.

"Objective Whereas the contribution of α-synuclein to neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease is well accepted, the putative impact of its close homologue, β-synuclein, is enigmatic. β-Synuclein is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system, as is α-synuclein, but the physiological functions of both proteins remain unknown. Recent findings have supported the view that β-synuclein can act as an ameliorating regulator of α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity, having neuroprotective rather than neurodegenerative capabilities, and being nonaggregating due to the absence of most of the aggregation-promoting NAC domain. However, a mutation of β-synuclein linked to dementia with Lewy bodies rendered the protein neurotoxic in transgenic mice,",β-synuclein aggregates and induces neurodegeneration in dopaminergic neurons,Lewy Body Dementia

Results Supporting the hypothesis that β-synuclein can act as a neurodegeneration-inducing factor, we demonstrated that wild-type β-synuclein is neurotoxic for cultured primary neurons. Furthermore, β-synuclein formed proteinase K-resistant aggregates in dopaminergic neurons in vivo, leading to pronounced and progressive neurodegeneration in rats.

Lewy in 1912 in neurons of the basal forebrain and thalamus of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (Lewy, 1913). More than eight decades after Dr. Lewy's original report, international consensus criteria (see Table 33.1) were created that formally acknowledged the existence of a syndrome of dementia with parkinsonism associated with LBs in other brain areas such as the limbic system and neocortex (McKeith et al., 1996).

"Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, are neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (aSyn) in intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies.

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Early concepts looking at PD as purely a motor disorder have led the way to seeing it as a much more widespread neurological disease with affective, cognitive, and autonomic manifestations. The etiology of PD is still unknown, but important steps have been made to understand its pathogenesis. To a large extent, these derived from the identification of genetic variants of PD. Mutations in several genes have been discovered that cause monogenic PD. Several drugs are now available for the treatment of PD patients.

Further, CSF neurosin and α-synuclein concentrations were positively associated in controls, PD and PDD patients and both proteins were highly correlated to CSF levels of phosphorylated tau in all investigated groups.

LBs are primarily composed of misfolded α-synuclein (aSyn), and neurofibrillary tangles are primarily composed of tau protein. Importantly, upon pathological evaluation, most AD and PD/Lewy body dementia cases exhibit mixed pathology, with the co-occurrence of both LB and neurofibrillary tangles, among other protein inclusions.

"Mounting evidence suggests the key role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dopaminergic neurotoxicity of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Activation of NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and inhibition of methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) can regulate BDNF upregulation. However, the regulation of BDNF by Nrf2 and MeCP2 in the PD pathogenesis has not been reported. Here, we revealed that Nrf2/MeCP2 coordinately regulated BDNF transcription, reversing the decreased levels of BDNF expression in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated SH-SY5Y cells and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice.

Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of MeCP2-HDO, a DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO) silencing MeCP2 expression, ameliorated dopaminergic neurotoxicity in MPTP-treated mice via activation of Nrf2 and BDNF expression.

Interesting, there were correlations between BDNF and Nrf2 (or MeCP2) expression in the striatum from DLB patients.

Using the ligase chain reaction to detect dinucleotide deletions, we report here that UBB+ 1 transcripts are present in each neurodegenerative disease studied (tauo- and synucleinopathies) and even in control brain samples.

"α-Synuclein has been linked to amyloidogenesis in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously shown that a peptide comprising residues 68-78 of α-synuclein is the minimum fragment that, like α-synuclein itself, forms amyloid fibrils and exhibits toxicity towards cells in culture. Hughes et al. [J. Biol. Chem. 275 (2000) 25109] showed that an N-methylated derivative of Aβ(25-35) inhibited the formation of fibrils by Aβ(25-35) and reduced its toxicity. We have now extended this concept to an amyloidogenic α-synuclein-based peptide. α-Synuclein(68-78), N-methylated at G1y73, was compared to non-methylated peptide.

"Data on diseases are generally skewed towards either positive or negative cases, depending on their prevalence. The problem of imbalance can significantly impact the performance of classification models, resulting in biased predictions and reduced model accuracy for the underrepresented class. Other factors that affect the performance of classifiers include intrinsic data characteristics, such as noise, outliers, and within-class imbalance, which complicate the learning task. Contemporary imbalance handling techniques employ clustering with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to generate realistic synthetic data that preserves the underlying data distribution, generalizes unseen data and mitigates overfitting to noisy points.

"Introduction: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment. Despite standardized programming, some patients seem to respond very well to DBS (optimal responders), while others seem to react poorly (poor responders). The objective was to compare the area of tissue activated between optimal and poor responders and determine whether there is a potential optimal stimulation area. Methods: For 338 PD patients with STN-DBS, four outcome categories on the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor part were assessed: hemibody, rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor",Anatomical Group-Level Studies of the Volume of Tissue Activated by Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson’s Disease: A Model for Targeting?,Parkinson's Disease

To enable the responder groups comparison, all VTAs were aggregated into a so-called heatmap in normalized space.

To better understand the role of pathological α-syn in disease, many labs use α-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs). Neurons take up the PFFs, which act as seeds to corrupt endogenously expressed α-syn, inducing it to form aggregates very similar to those found in diseased brains.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an idiopathic disease caused by the loss or degeneration of the dopaminergic (dopamine-producing) neurons in the brain and characterized by various inflammatory and apoptotic responses in the neuronal cells. Phosphoinositide 3–kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) axis is responsible for neuronal survival by providing a number of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic milieu that prevent the progression of PD. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a natural cofactor that has antioxidant capacity and contributes to various metabolic processes. ALA can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and contribute to numerous neuroprotective effects.

"Vascular dementia (VD), characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral disorders, has seen a rapid increase in prevalence in recent years. However, effective treatments for VD remain unavailable. Due to its regenerative potential, stem cell therapy has garnered attention as a promising approach for VD treatment, yet it has shown limited effects on cognitive and behavioral impairments caused by the disease. To address this limitation, this study aimed to develop a novel treatment using human embryonic stem cell-derived multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MMSCs).

"Folic acid plays an important role in neuroplasticity and in the maintenance of neuronal integrity. Folate is a co-factor in one-carbon metabolism during which it promotes the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine, a highly reactive sulfur-containing amino acid.

Results: This review identifies a large number of biochemical markers derived from CSF and blood. There is a considerable overlap of VCI-SSVD clinical symptoms with those of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although most of the published studies are small and their findings remain to be replicated in larger cohorts, several biomarkers have shown promise in separating VCI-SSVD from AD.

"There is a perfusion deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD), commencing in the precuneus and spreading to other parts of the cerebral cortex. The deficit anticipates the development of dementia, contributes to brain damage, and is caused by both functional and structural abnormalities of the cerebral vasculature. Most of the abnormalities are probably secondary to the accumulation of Aβ but the consequent hypoperfusion may, in turn, increase Aβ production. In the early stages of disease, abnormalities that cause vasoconstriction predominate. These include cholinergic vascular denervation, inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, increased production of endothelin-1 production and possibly also of angiotensin",Cerebral Hypoperfusion and the Energy Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease,Vascular Dementia

"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents an increasing worldwide healthcare epidemic. Secondary preventive disease-modifying treatments under clinical development are considered most effective when initiated as early as possible in the pathophysiological course and progression of the disease. Major targets are to enhance clearance and to reduce cerebral accumulation of amyloid, decrease hyperphosphorylation of tau and the generation of neurofibrillary tangles, reduce inflammation, and finally progressive neurodegeneration. Comprehensive sets of biological markers are needed to characterize the pathophysiological mechanisms, indicate effects of treatment and to facilitate early characterisation and detection of AD during the prodromal or even at asymptomatic stages.

"The brain has high metabolic and energy needs and requires continuous cerebral blood flow (CBF), which is facilitated by a tight coupling between neuronal activity, CBF, and metabolism. Upon neuronal activation, there is an increase in energy demand, which is then met by a hemodynamic response that increases CBF. Such regional CBF increase in response to neuronal activation is observed using neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography.
