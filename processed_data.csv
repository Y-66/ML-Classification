"Insulin resistance is a condition characterized by the attenuated biological response in the presence of normal or elevated insulin level and therefore is characterized by the impaired sensitivity to insulin and impaired glucose disposal and utilization. Insulin resistance in brain/Brain insulin resistance (BIR) is accompanied by the various manifestations including alteration in glucose sensing by hypothalamic neurons, impaired sympathetic outflow in response to hypoglycemia, increased ROS production, impaired mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the brain, cognitive deficits and neuronal cell damage. It has been reported that the disrupted insulin signaling is accompanied by the reduced expression of insulin receptor (IR)/insulin receptor",Brain insulin resistance mediated cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration: Type-3 diabetes or Alzheimer’s Disease,Alzheimer's Disease,Review,"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, HR, India; Shree Guru Gobind Singh Tricentenary University, Gurugram, HR, India"
"Prolactin is a pituitary anterior lobe hormone that plays a crucial role in milk secretion from the mammary glands. Hyperprolactinemia is a common endocrine disorder characterized by abnormally elevated levels of prolactin in the serum. Recent research findings indicate that prolactin also exerts important physiological effects beyond lactation, including effects on brain health and the central nervous system.

"Glycoprotein 88 (GP88) is a secreted biomarker overexpressed in various cancers, as well as neurological and inflammatory diseases. In this study, we introduce the first disposable electrochemical immunosensor for GP88 detection that is built on a screen-printed carbon electrode modified with carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Surface carboxyl groups are activated using EDC/NHS chemistry, followed by covalent attachment of streptavidin to facilitate the capture of a biotinylated anti-GP88 antibody. When exposed to GP88, the sensor shows a 19% increase in charge-transfer resistance, used as the sensor's response parameter, indicating a binding between GP88 and its biorecognition element.

"We introduce a novel framework that integrates Hodge decomposition with Filtered Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity to analyze dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in EEG signals. This method leverages graph-based topology and simplicial analysis to explore transient connectivity patterns at multiple scales, addressing noise, sparsity, and computational efficiency. The temporal EEG data are first sparsified by keeping only the most globally important connections, instantaneous connectivity at these connections is then filtered by global long-term stable correlations. This tensor is then decomposed into three orthogonal components to study signal flows over higher-order structures such as triangle and loop structures.

"Different forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have shown strong potential as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. We hypothesized that p-tau proteoforms simultaneously phosphorylated at two different sites may have an increased diagnostic value compared with tau phosphorylated at a single site. Here, we developed two immunoassays detecting CSF and plasma tau simultaneously phosphorylated at both T181 and T231 (p-tau181&231) and at T217 and T231 (p-tau217&231). Subsequently, we measured CSF and plasma p-tau181&231, p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 levels in two cohorts across the AD continuum and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients (discovery n =",Immunoassay detection of multiphosphorylated tau proteoforms as cerebrospinal fluid and plasma Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers,Alzheimer's Disease,Article,"Department of Medicine and Surgery, Università degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia, PG, Italy; Laboratory of Neurochemistry, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Department of Medicine and Surgery, Università degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia, PG, Italy"
"In this work, we developed potential multifunctional agents to combat Alzheimer's disease. According to our strategy, fragments of tacrine and donepezil were merged in a unique hybrid structure. After successfully synthesizing the compounds, they were evaluated for their dual AChE/BuChE inhibitor potential and neuroprotector response using a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model. Most of the compounds showed promising activity. Among them, the hybrid with 2,5-dimetoxysubstitution (3b) was the most potent analogue, triggering dual potent AChE/BuChE inhibition with low nanomolar affinity (IC<inf>50</inf> ∼ 300 nM) and low toxicity to human liver cancer cells (HepG2).

"The choroid plexus (ChP) is implicated in inflammation and supports the clearance of waste byproducts, particularly those related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Increases in ChP volume have been associated with older age and cognitive decline in both clinical and healthy cohorts. However, the clearance of waste products in the brain is also related to sleep, and sleep quality may contribute to ChP dysfunction and cognitive decline. In the present work, it was therefore hypothesized that the association between age and cognitive performance is mediated by ChP volume, however this is conditional on sleep quality.

"Despite the loss of neurons during aging and the early stages of neurodegenerative disease, many cortical brain functions remain remarkably intact. Although this resilience is traditionally attributed to redundancy in neural networks, a new study uncovers a more active mechanism: dynamic homeostatic processes that preserve cortical representations in the face of neuronal loss. These processes recruit previously unengaged neurons and rearrange neuronal activity patterns to compensate for neuronal loss and maintain the integrity of representational maps in the brain. © Springer Nature America, Inc. 2025.

"Recent research has revealed that autophagy, a major catabolic process in cells, is dysregulated in several neuromuscular diseases and contributes to the muscle wasting caused by non-muscle disorders (e.g. cancer cachexia) or during aging (i.e. sarcopenia). From there, the idea arose to interfere with autophagy or manipulate its regulatory signalling to help restore muscle homeostasis and attenuate disease progression. The major difficulty for the development of therapeutic strategies is to restore a balanced autophagic flux, due to the dynamic nature of autophagy.

"Purpose of Review: This article reviews the clinical approach to the diagnosis of adult patients presenting with chorea, using Huntington disease (HD) as a point of reference, and presents the clinical elements that help in the diagnostic workup. Principles of management for chorea and some of the associated features of other choreic syndromes are also described. Recent Findings: Mutations in the C9orf72 gene, previously identified in families with a history of frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or both, have been recognized as one of the most prevalent causes of HD phenocopies in the white population.

"Neurodegenerative disorders are commonly encountered in medical practices. Such diseases can lead to major morbidity and mortality among the affected individuals. The molecular pathogenesis of these disorders is not yet clear. Recent literature has revealed that mutations in RNA-binding proteins are a key cause of several human neuronal-based diseases.

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of combined semiquantitative and quantitative assessment of brain atrophy in the diagnostic workup of the behavioural-variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Methods: Three neuroradiologists defined brain atrophy grading and identified atrophy pattern suggestive of bvFTD on 3D-T1 brain MRI of 112 subjects using a semiquantitative rating scale (Kipps’). A quantitative atrophy assessment was performed using two different automated software (Quantib® ND and Icometrix®). A combined semiquantitative and quantitative assessment of brain atrophy was made to evaluate the improvement in brain atrophy grading to identify probable bvFTD patients.

We generated several cell models of tauopathy in order to study the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in diseases involving abnormal changes of tau protein. N2a neuroblastoma cell lines were created that inducibly express different variants of the repeat domain of tau (tau<inf>RD</inf>) when exposed to doxycycline (Tet-On system). The following three constructs were chosen: (i) the repeat domain of tau that coincides with the core of Alzheimer paired helical filaments; (ii) the repeat domain with the deletion mutation ΔK280 known from frontotemporal dementia and highly prone to spontaneous aggregation; and (iii) the repeat domain with ΔK280 and two proline point mutations,Inducible expression of tau repeat domain in cell models of tauopathy: Aggregation is toxic to cells but can be reversed by inhibitor drugs,Frontotemporal Dementia,Article,"Max Planck Research Unit for Structural Molecular Biology at DESY, Hamburg, Germany"
"Introduction Aphasia has long been recognized as a common language disorder typically resulting from acute left hemisphere lesions, often caused by strokes. A progressive form of aphasia was first described over a century ago by Arnold Pick, the famed Prague neurologist, who detailed the language deficits in his initial group of patients (Pick 1892). The modern term, progressive aphasia, was introduced by Marsel Mesulam in 1982 in a landmark paper in which he described six patients who presented with language deficits in the absence of other behavioral abnormalities.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present short review summarizes some of the most important personality changes in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Personality changes in old age are usually minimal. Cluster B personality disorders appear to become less prevalent. Significant changes in personality are typically associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (e.g., slowly progressive sociopathy), Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to incipient dementia or underlying medical illness.

Retrospectively, his alcohol dependency itself was considered an early manifestation of right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia. ©",Putative Alcohol-Related Dementia as an Early Manifestation of Right Temporal Variant of Frontotemporal Dementia,Frontotemporal Dementia,Article,"Department of Neuropsychiatry, Japanese Red Cross Ashikaga Hospital, Ashikaga, Tochigi, Japan; Department of Rehabilitation, Japanese Red Cross Ashikaga Hospital, Ashikaga, Tochigi, Japan"
"Eukaryotic cells are equipped with an intricate proteostasis network (PN), comprising nearly 3,000 components dedicated to preserving proteome integrity and sustaining protein homeostasis. This protective system is particularly important under conditions of external and intrinsic cell stress, where inherently dynamic proteins may unfold and lose functionality. A decline in proteostasis capacity is associated with the aging process, resulting in a reduced folding efficiency of newly synthesized proteins and a deficit in the cellular capacity to degrade misfolded proteins. A critical consequence of PN insufficiency is the accumulation of cytotoxic protein aggregates that underlie various age-related neurodegenerative conditions and other pathologies.",Interplay of Proteostasis Capacity and Protein Aggregation: Implications for Cellular Function and Disease,Frontotemporal Dementia,Review,"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen, Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; Research School of Behavioural and Cognitive Neurosciences, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universität Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Niedersachsen, Germany; Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, Planegg, Bayern, Germany; Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy), Munich, Bayern, Germany; Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s (ASAP) Collaborative Research Network, Chevy Chase, MD, United States"

The term ‘tauopathies’ was coined to refer to this seemingly heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with filamentous tau deposits as their predominant histopathological feature.

"The traditional method of classifying neurodegenerative diseases is based on the original clinico-pathological concept supported by 'consensus' criteria and data from molecular pathological studies. This review discusses first, current problems in classification resulting from the coexistence of different classificatory schemes, the presence of disease heterogeneity and multiple pathologies, the use of 'signature' brain lesions in diagnosis, and the existence of pathological processes common to different diseases. Second, three models of neurodegenerative disease are proposed: (1) that distinct diseases exist ('discrete' model), (2) that relatively distinct diseases exist but exhibit overlapping features ('overlap' model), and (3) that distinct diseases do not","On the 'classification' of neurodegenerative disorders: Discrete entities, overlap or continuum?",Lewy Body Dementia,Review,"Aston University, Birmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom"

"Objective Whereas the contribution of α-synuclein to neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease is well accepted, the putative impact of its close homologue, β-synuclein, is enigmatic. β-Synuclein is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system, as is α-synuclein, but the physiological functions of both proteins remain unknown. Recent findings have supported the view that β-synuclein can act as an ameliorating regulator of α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity, having neuroprotective rather than neurodegenerative capabilities, and being nonaggregating due to the absence of most of the aggregation-promoting NAC domain. However, a mutation of β-synuclein linked to dementia with Lewy bodies rendered the protein neurotoxic in transgenic mice,",β-synuclein aggregates and induces neurodegeneration in dopaminergic neurons,Lewy Body Dementia,Article,"Department of Neurology, Universitätsmedizin Göttingen, Gottingen, Niedersachsen, Germany; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Farm Research Campus, Ashburn, VA, United States; Department of Neurodegeneration and Restorative Research, Universitätsmedizin Göttingen, Gottingen, Niedersachsen, Germany; Rudolf-Virchow-Zentrum, Wurzburg, Bayern, Germany; School of Engineering and Science, Constructor University, Bremen, Bremen, Germany; Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Niedersachsen, Germany; Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen, Bonn, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany"

Diagnostic confirmation is made by pathologic autopsy: abundant presence of Lewy bodies (LB) in the neurons of the cortex and other areas in the brain. The LB are eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions, spherical and consist of more than 20 protein components.

"Introduction: Delusional parasitosis (DP) has been described as among the most challenging diagnosis to manage in dermatology and psychiatry literature. Patients with this perplexing and enigmatic condition present potentially to a wide range of specialties including primary or emergency care, dermatology, infectious diseases, neurology, and psychiatry. DP is probably underdiagnosed from patients’ underreporting of symptoms of being infested with parasites, resulting from the associated social stigma. In addition, specialists who most often encounter these patients often possess low familiarity and comfort level in the diagnosis and therapy of this disorder.

"BACKGROUND: Lewy body diseases (LBDs) feature deficiency of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine in the left ventricular myocardium and sympathetic intra-neuronal deposition of the protein alpha-synuclein (αS). LBDs therefore are autonomic synucleinopathies.

We report an extended model that enables predictions about the progression of LBDs and effects of genetic predispositions and treatments on that progression.

"Until recently, the most significant issue facing a family physician regarding the diagnosis and treatment of dementia was ruling out delirium and potentially treatable etiologies. However, as more treatment options become available, it will become increasingly important to diagnose dementia early. Dementia may be suspected if memory deficits are exhibited during the medical history and physical examination. Information from the patient's family members, friends and caregivers may also point to signs of dementia. Distinguishing among age-related cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease may be difficult and requires evaluation of cognitive and functional status.

"Background and Objectives – Years before diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple system atrophy (MSA), mild prodromal manifestations can be detected. Longitudinal follow-up of people with prodromal synucleinopathy, particularly idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), enables in-depth clinical phenotyping of early disease, which could facilitate stratification for clinical trials, provide the definition of appropriate end points, or predict phenoconversion more precisely. The aim of this study was to update and expand on previous studies assessing clinical evolution from iRBD to clinically diagnosed disease, up to 14 years before diagnosis.Methods – People with polysomnography-proven iRBD",Evolution of Motor and Nonmotor Characteristics in an Idiopathic/Isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Cohort,Lewy Body Dementia,Article,"Institut-Hôpital Neurologique de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychology, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Psychology, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada"
"Excessive accumulation of alpha synuclein (a-syn) in the brain has been implicated in several degenerative neurological disorders, most notably Parkinson's disease. The aggregation of a-syn is the major component of intraneuronal inclusions, Lewy bodies, which are neuropathological features, observed in Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and other synucleopathies. Diverse cellular events can contribute to a-syn accumulation, aggregation, and to subsequent Lewy body formation. These factors include genetic mutations of synuclein, parkin, or the deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), leading to reduced clearance of a-syn by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway (UPP). Furthermore, intracellular insults include environmental factors and an age-related",Dynamic modeling of alpha-synuclein aggregation for the sporadic and genetic forms of Parkinson's disease,Lewy Body Dementia,Article,"Cellworks Group Inc., Saratoga, CA, United States; Department of Neurology, The National Cancer Institute, Davis, CA, United States"

"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of α-synuclein in the brain. Ferroptosis, a recently identified form of regulated cell death, is critical in PD pathogenesis due to its association with iron deposition, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and impaired lipid peroxidation clearance. This cell death mechanism is closely linked to several pathogenic processes in PD, including α-synuclein aggregation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, microglia-induced neuroinflammation, and neuromelanin accumulation.

"Background: Circadian rhythms are critical homeostatic mechanisms in biological systems, regulating a wide range of physiological processes including metabolism, endocrinology, and cognitive functions. In most individuals, these rhythms are significantly altered with aging, such as reduced variability in sleep-wake cycles and changes in their timing. These disruptions can accelerate age-related physiological decline, which is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. It is assumed that relationships between circadian mechanisms and aging processes determine the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders.

The deficit anticipates the development of dementia, contributes to brain damage, and is caused by both functional and structural abnormalities of the cerebral vasculature. Most of the abnormalities are probably secondary to the accumulation of Aβ but the consequent hypoperfusion may, in turn, increase Aβ production. In the early stages of disease, abnormalities that cause vasoconstriction predominate. These include cholinergic vascular denervation, inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, increased production of endothelin-1 production and possibly also of angiotensin",Cerebral Hypoperfusion and the Energy Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease,Vascular Dementia,Article,"Dementia Research Group, Bristol Medical School, Bristol, United Kingdom"

"Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered by some to be a prodromal phase of a progressive disease (i.e., neurodegeneration) resulting in dementia; however, a substantial portion of individuals (ranging from 5-30%) remain cognitively stable over the long term (sMCI). The etiology of sMCI is unclear but may be linked to cerebrovascular disease (CVD), as evidence from longitudinal studies suggest a significant proportion of individuals with vasculopathy remain stable over time.

"Preeclampsia affects one in twelve of the 130 million pregnancies a year. The lack of an effective therapeutic to prevent or treat it is responsible for an annual global cost burden of 100 billion US dollars. Preeclampsia also affects these women later in life as it is a recognised risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke and vascular dementia. Our laboratory demonstrated that preeclampsia is associated with high soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and low heme oxygenase-1 (HO1/Hmox1) expression.

"Case Description: An 82-year-old man with dementia, gait disturbance, and a small cerebral infarction owing to severe bilateral carotid artery stenosis was successfully treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS). Preoperative cerebral vascular reactivity was reduced in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. We performed CAS to treat right internal carotid artery stenosis. Following CAS, cerebral vascular reactivity showed an increase in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Memory, fluency, and attention also showed improvement. Conclusions: This case illustrates the potential benefit of single-stage CAS for cognitive function in severe bilateral carotid artery stenosis without hyperperfusion syndrome. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

"Dementia and neurological conditions leading to dementia have had an increasing impact on healthcare and healthcare planning around the world in recent decades. This chapter aims to situate dementia into a context suitable for students, practitioners and researchers in the field of communication sciences and disorders. The dementia categories most commonly referred to both in the media and the scientific literature are irreversible dementias. Patterns of progressive neurological changes that are typically associated with different diseases leading to dementia involve changes both within and between brain cells, such as abnormal protein deposits.

"Subcortical hyperintensities (SH) on neuroimaging are a prominent feature of vascular dementia (VaD) and SH severity correlates with cognitive impairment in this population. Previous studies demonstrated that SH burden accounts for a degree of the cognitive burden among VaD patients, although it remains unclear if individual factors such as cognitive reserve influence cognitive status in VaD. To address this issue, we examined 36 individuals diagnosed with probable VaD (age = 77.56; education = 12). All individuals underwent MMSE evaluations and MRI brain scans. We predicted that individuals with higher educational attainment would exhibit less cognitive difficulty despite similar levels of",Influence of education on subcortical hyperintensities and global cognitive status in vascular dementia,Vascular Dementia,Article,"Department of Psychology, University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, United States; Department of Psychiatry, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, United States; Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, The Warren Alpert Medical School, Providence, RI, United States"
"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders are a common manifestation of HIV infection, affecting more than half of HIV-infected individuals, including those receiving targeted antiviral therapy. A common feature of the course of HIV infection during therapy is large-scale immune responses in the brain. Several pathways are involved in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection: Cellular entry, inflammatory processes in microglia, activation of astroglia, myeloid cells, and damage to brain vessels leading to neurocirculatory disorders.

"Vascular dementia (VaD) is the term applied to patients with an acquired dementia syndrome due to the effects of cerebrovascular disease. A variety of different vascular lesions can cause cognitive impairment, including clinical stroke, subclinical brain injury, global cerebral hypoperfusion, and cerebral hemorrhage. Cerebrovascular disease also frequently coexists with other pathologies in the aging brain commonly resulting in syndromes of cerebrovascular disease “mixed” with other neurodegenerative pathologies. Current diagnostic criteria for VaD require correlation of clinical features with neuroimaging findings. The prognosis and clinical course of VaD is more variable than other dementia syndromes and patients often stabilize (or even",Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Vascular Dementia,Vascular Dementia,Book chapter,"Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, NV, United States; Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States"
"Cerebrovascular disease is the third leading cause of death, the second leading cause of dementia, and the most common cause of disability worldwide. Carotid disease is responsible for approximately 70% of ischemic stroke cases, but it is the only cause that can be addressed through revascularization. The primary goals of carotid reconstruction—whether through endarterectomy, bypass, or stenting—are to prevent ischemic stroke, alleviate neurological symptoms and complaints, and potentially prevent vascular dementia, cognitive disorders, and senility. © 2025 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

"Hypertension prevalence and cardiovascular risk gradually with age. However this aging process seems to take a more rapid course in some individuals, as reflected in the Early Vascular Aging (EVA) syndrome. Age and high blood pressure are the two main determinants of arterial stiffness which is the core of EVA: the impaired elasticity of the media layer of large elastic arteries (mainly the aorta), a process that can be measured by pulse wave velocity. In elderly hyperten - sives, large arteries stiffen and systolic and pulse pressures increase, due to wave reflections.
